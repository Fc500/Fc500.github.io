<h1>Rules</h1>
  <h3>1. If something seems like it could be a (good) rule, then it probably is.
    </br>2. Have a registered account and a profile picture. This is to prevent spam. 
    </br>3. You must identify yourself as a member of one of the GD wikis. 
    </br>4. Don’t swear too much (“too much” is something determined by the mods). 
    </br>5. No posting any NSFW content. 
    </br>6. No racism or sexism of any kind (slurs fall under this category). 
    </br>7. Do not spam (again, what spam is is determined by staff). 
    </br>8. No abusing bot commands (what abuse is is determined by mods). 
    </br>9. Trying to bypass any rule is punishable as well. 
    </br>10. STAY ON TOPIC
</br>11. No religious/anti-religious talk (to prevent fighting) or politics, conspiracy theories, trash-talk, etc. (for the same reason) 
</br>12. Don't have the same nickname or profile picture as another user 
</br>13. No innapropriate nicknames (INCLUDES swear words) or 3+ alt accounts </h3>
