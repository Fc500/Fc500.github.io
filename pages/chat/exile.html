    <p>Hey look guys. I'm sorry about everything that's happened. I was in a bad place, but that does not excuse my actions. I am sincerely sorry about what I did, the things I've said, my reactions, and general immaturity I've displaced in the recent days. About GDChat, yes I was a terrible owner, that is a fact. But I have managed to learn from my experiences, and cannot be happier about GDChat's
      sucessor GDWiki Offical Chat. You guys deserved better, and I'm glad you guys are now happy. I don't expect forgiveness, but it's important for me to write this anyways. I am especially sorry to Imanoob, Brw, and Qwert for my behavior towards them when they were trying to help.
      I hope this is recived with a semi-positive reception, but I don't expect any better. This is most likely a terrible apology, but I'm trying.... Since I've hurt so many people, I plan to take Sonar's advice to heart and "Stop bugging us and get out". Don't expect that much from me
      in the future, but I wanted to clear this up before I left. Goodbye, I hope this did my actions justice... </p>
